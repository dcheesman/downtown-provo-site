# Project overview

You are working on the public website for **Downtown Provo Inc. (DPI)**.

Goals:

- Very simple, static, fast-loading site.
- Clear “hub” for people to find:
	- Live updates (Instagram)
	- Events (calendar)
	- Email newsletter signup
	- Useful maps
	- DPI membership form
- Easy to maintain by non-technical people in the future.

The site should NOT use heavy frameworks or build tools unless explicitly requested. Prefer plain HTML, CSS, and a small amount of vanilla JavaScript.

# Tech stack and structure

- Use **plain HTML5** for markup.
- Use a single global stylesheet: `styles.css`.
- Use a single JS file: `main.js` for small behaviors.
- No React, Next.js, Vue, Astro, Tailwind, or any bundler by default.
- The site must work as a **pure static site** so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages or Vercel without any build step.
- Indent HTML / CSS / JS using **tabs**, not spaces.

File layout:

- `index.html` – main home page.
- `maps.html` – maps page.
- `styles.css` – global styles.
- `main.js` – any JavaScript logic.
- Optionally `data/video-config.json` for video embed configuration.

# Brand and design

- Brand primary color: `#65BEB8`. Create a CSS custom property:

	```css
	:root {
		--dpi-teal: #65BEB8;
	}
	```

- Overall visual style:
	- Clean, modern, civic / professional.
	- Lots of white space and good legibility.
	- Avoid overly “techy” or flashy animations.
- Typography:
	- Use a system font stack (e.g. `system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`).
	- Use clear hierarchy with headings (`h1`/`h2`/`h3`) and body text.
- Layout:
	- Mobile-first, responsive.
	- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the home page “card grid”.

# Accessibility and quality

When generating or editing code:

- Use semantic HTML5 elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Ensure the site is usable with keyboard navigation.
- Add meaningful `alt` text on images and `aria-label` where needed.
- Maintain good color contrast when using `#65BEB8` on backgrounds or text.
- Keep HTML and CSS minimal and readable, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

# index.html requirements

`index.html` is the main landing page.

High-level layout:

1. **Site header**
	- Contains DPI logo (placeholder image or text for now).
	- Logo should be clickable and link to `/` (the home page).
	- Header is full-width, with padding and a solid background or subtle border.

2. **Hero video section**
	- A full-width responsive container for an embedded video (likely a YouTube or Vimeo iframe).
	- The video must maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio and scale with the viewport.
	- Do NOT hard-code width/height on the iframe in a way that breaks responsiveness.

	Behavior for video URL:

	- Use `data/video-config.json` with a structure like:

		```json
		{
			"embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXAMPLE"
		}
		```

	- In `main.js`, on page load:
		- Fetch `/data/video-config.json`.
		- If it loads successfully and contains a valid `embedUrl`, set that as the iframe `src`.
		- If it fails, fall back to a sensible default `src` that is hard-coded in the HTML.
	- Keep this logic simple and robust so it works on GitHub Pages.

	Google Sheets integration (stretch goal):

	- The long-term goal is to optionally pull the embed URL from a Google Sheet.
	- When asked, you should:
		- Expect a Google Sheet whose data is published via the “Publish to web” feature as CSV or JSON.
		- Add a small function in `main.js` that:
			- Fetches the published URL.
			- Parses out a single cell containing the embed URL.
			- Updates the video iframe `src`.
		- Preserve the JSON-based configuration as a fallback if the Sheet fetch fails.

3. **Flexible grid section ("hub" cards)**

	This section is a grid of cards, each with:

	- Title text
	- Small arrow image or icon pointing to the button
	- Button that links to the relevant page or external URL

	Layout requirements:

	- On **wide screens**: cards should display in a multi-column layout (2–3 columns depending on width).
	- On **narrow screens / mobile**: cards should stack vertically in a single column.
	- Spacing should be generous and consistent.

	Cards and their targets:

	1. **Live Updates**
		- Title: “Live Updates”
		- Button label: “Follow on Instagram”
		- Link: `https://www.instagram.com/downtownprovo/`

	2. **Events**
		- Title: “Events”
		- Button label: “Event Calendar”
		- Link: (use a clear placeholder URL like `/calendar` or an externally provided calendar URL).

	3. **Email Newsletter**
		- Title: “Email Newsletter”
		- Button label: “Sign Up for Updates”
		- Link: `https://downtownprovo.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=38ee5bc14b316b65d90060a24&id=fe2c830353`

	4. **Useful Maps**
		- Title: “Useful Maps”
		- Button label: “View Maps”
		- Link: `/maps.html`

	5. **Become a Member**
		- Title: “Become a Member”
		- Button label: “Membership Form”
		- Link: use a placeholder like `https://example.com/dpi-membership-form` unless the real URL is specified.

	Content rules:

	- Do not create new cards beyond these five unless explicitly asked.
	- Implement cards so that links and text are easy to update in the HTML.

# maps.html requirements

`maps.html` is a simple page focused on GIS maps.

Layout:

1. **Header**
	- Reuse the same header component as `index.html`.
	- Logo should link back to `/`.

2. **Main content**
	- A section with a heading like “Downtown Provo Maps”.
	- One or more `<p>` elements briefly describing what the maps show and who they are for.
	- An `<iframe>` that embeds the GIS maps already created for DPI.
		- The iframe should be responsive (use a container with aspect ratio or a max-width layout).
		- The iframe `src` must be easy to update in the HTML.

# Styling details

General:

- Apply a max-width container for main content (e.g. `max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.5rem;`).
- Use consistent spacing scale (for example, multiples of `0.5rem` or `1rem`).
- Style buttons as:
	- `<a>` tags with a `.button` class.
	- Background with `var(--dpi-teal)`.
	- White text, border-radius, and a hover state with a slightly darker teal.
- The grid section should have a light background or subtle border to visually separate it from the hero.

Responsive behavior:

- Use a mobile-first media query approach.
- At small widths, stack everything in a single column.
- At a breakpoint around 768px or similar, switch the cards section to a multi-column grid.

# JavaScript guidelines (`main.js`)

- Keep JavaScript minimal and focused:
	- Video embed configuration loading.
	- Any small enhancements like adding a CSS class when JS is enabled.
- Do not introduce third-party JS dependencies without explicit instructions.
- Write functions in plain JavaScript with clear names and small scope.
- Add comments explaining any Fetch / Google Sheets logic so it is easy to maintain.

# GitHub and deployment considerations

- Keep all HTML, CSS, JS, and data files in the repository root or simple subfolders (`/data`).
- Ensure `index.html` lives at the root so GitHub Pages can serve it as the entry point.
- Avoid any absolute paths that assume a specific custom domain; prefer root-relative paths like `/maps.html` or `./maps.html`.
- When you introduce new files or substantial changes, also update `README.md` to reflect:
	- New sections or pages.
	- Any configuration files the DPI team might edit (like `data/video-config.json`).

# How to use these rules

When asked to create or update code for this repository:

1. Follow this document as the source of truth for:
	- Which pages exist.
	- Required sections.
	- Content links and brand color.
2. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless new files are clearly required.
3. Do not introduce new frameworks or tools unless explicitly asked to.
4. Keep the implementation simple, readable, and suitable for long-term maintenance by a small organization.
